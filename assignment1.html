<p>In Kate Wagner’s essay, Page 404, she details her nostalgic relationship with the constantly evolving internet. Right off the bat Wagner sets the reminiscent tone of this essay by introducing readers to a personal anecdote detailing the erasure of her first experiences when interacting with the early web. This paints the perfect picture for readers who are unfamiliar with the innerworkings of the internet’s primitive days and allows us to better grasp the author’s ambivalent feelings towards its advancement. In a world where user interfaces didn’t reach beyond hyperlinks, archaic directories, and glacial loading speeds, I can’t help but wonder why this could have a negative trade off. Wagner’s intimate sequence of the internet’s history will soon change my mind.<p/>
    <p>Firstly, I admire the many ways Wagner humanizes the internet by using phrases such as “the self-eating internet,” or associating early flash drive assets with “disembodied ghosts”. For example, when comparing her interactions with today’s app-based web to the previous DIY driven blogosphere, there is a specific quote that allows me to empathize with the replacement of an older generation’s memories Wagner writes about. “I open my Instagram account to post on my Instagram Story feed that I’m writing this essay about internet nostalgia. There I can attach kitschy gifts to my story like fancy stickers—I look at my options, and the offerings remind me of various moments from my online past. There’s an image of sparkles that takes me back to the flash-based dress-up games I once played as a tween.” The idea of seeing images linked to past personal experiences recycled into decorations for a larger-scale platform is thought provoking for a reader in my shoes. It makes me wonder how long the data on the apps I use has existed for, what features remained, and how much information has disappeared.<p/>
        <p>In the next couple sections Wagner addresses the impacts of user interface as well as their aesthetics and their effect on popularity/audience. It’s interesting to wonder what features from previous social media platforms have been recycled into current social media. I was shocked when I found out the average website is believed to be less than 10 years old. This made me think about how the integration of user-friendly layouts has catalyzed the average life span of a website. My curiosity was inspired by a second quote early on in her essay, “When a website, especially one that invites mass participation, goes offline or executes a huge dump of its data and resources, it’s as if a smallish Library of Alexandria has been burned to the ground… Ignored is the scope and species of the lost material, or what it might have meant to the scant few who are left to salvage the digital wreck.” I mention this quote because it helps me understand the significance of what happens when a website goes out of service. I had previously thought everything on the internet lasts forever until I read the section ‘The Hell of Beautiful Interfaces'.<p/>
	       <p>All and all Wagner’s essay taught me a lot about the importance of keeping an accurate timeline of internet history due to its unpredictable change. As someone who has only experienced the internet in its most current state it was very enlightening to discover the amount of information lost during its four transitional periods. I am excited to tap into the early DIY ways of the internet by learning how to create a website from scratch. I hope by taking this class I can get a better understanding of a websites foundation and explore more methods of design beyond decorating a home page.<p/>
